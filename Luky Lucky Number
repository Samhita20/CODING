Every great chef knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Our chef has recently returned from the Lucky country. He observed that every restaurant in the Lucky country had a lucky number as its name. He believes that having a lucky number as a restaurant name can indeed turn out to be very lucky.

Our chef believes that it is possible to make a lucky number having N digits even luckier. Any number following the rules below is called Lucky lucky number -

1. The number contains only digits 4 and 7.
2. Count of digit 4 in the number should be divisible by 7.
3. Count of digit 7 in the number should be divisible by 4.

Help our chef to compute the count of digit 4 in the smallest Lucky lucky number having N digits.
