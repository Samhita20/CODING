Alice and Bob play the following game : There are N piles of stones with Si stones in the ith pile. Piles are numbered from 1 to N. 
Alice and Bob play alternately, with Alice starting. In a turn, the player chooses any pile i which has atleast i stones in it, and removes exactly i stones from it. 
The game ends when there is no such pile. The player who plays last wins the game. Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, who will win the game?

	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int t = sc.nextInt();
		while(t--!=0)
		{
		    int n = sc.nextInt();
		    int[] piles = new int[n];
		    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		        piles[i] = sc.nextInt();
		    int count = 0;
		    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		        count += piles[i]/(i+1);
		    if(count%2==0)
		        System.out.println("BOB");
		    else
		        System.out.println("ALICE");
		}
	}
