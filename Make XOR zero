Olya has written N binary integers (i.e. either zero or one) on a blackboard. She recently learned about XOR operation. 
Now she wants to erase exactly one integer in the array so that the XOR of the remaining N - 1 numbers is zero. 
Please help her to calculate the number of ways of doing so.

public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int t = sc.nextInt();
		while(t--!=0)
		{
		    int n = sc.nextInt();
		    int[] binary = new int[n];
		    int oneCount = 0, zeroCount=0;
		    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		    {
		        binary[i] = sc.nextInt();
		        if(binary[i]==1)
		            oneCount++;
		        else
		            zeroCount++;
		    }
		    if(oneCount%2==0) // 1 and 1 make a zero in xor, so we can select any of the zeroes to be reoved
		        System.out.println(zeroCount);
		    else // 1 and 0 make 1, we select the ones to be removed so tha only zeroe are left
		        System.out.println(oneCount);
		}
	}
