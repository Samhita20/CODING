The captain of the ship TITANIC is a little .... off the track. He needs to select the crew for the ship. But everyone seems to be eligible. So to test their intelligence, he plays a game.
The contestants have to stand in a line. They are given the numbers in the order in which they stand, starting from 1. The captain then removes all the contestants that are standing at an odd position.
Initially, standing people have numbers - 1,2,3,4,5...
After first pass, people left are - 2,4,...
After second pass - 4,....
And so on.
You want to board the ship as a crew member. Given the total number of applicants for a position, find the best place to stand in the line so that you are selected.

1 2 3 4 5 6.....N
we get answer as 2^floor(log N to the base 2)
for example, for n = 4,5,6,7 we get the answer as 4. This is because floor(log n 2 = 2) for all these numbers and 2^2 = 4 and hence the answer is 4. for 8 to 16 the answer will be 8 in the same way.

you can also keep halfing N(becuase aftee each iteration half numbers are removed) and multiplying the position by 2
(for each iteration the first element is a multiple of 2 starting from 2*1 and goes till only one element is left)  consequently and at the end, 
get the position by dividing by 2.

public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int t = sc.nextInt();
		while(t--!=0)
		{
		    int n = sc.nextInt();
		    int pos = 1;
		    while(n>0)
		    {
		        n /= 2;
		        pos *= 2;
		    }
		    System.out.println(pos/2);
		}
	}
