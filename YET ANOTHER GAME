Alice and Bob play the following game. They choose a number N to play with. The rules are as follows :

1) Alice plays first, and the two players alternate.

2) In his/her turn, a player can subtract from N any proper divisor (not equal to N) of N. The number thus obtained is the new N.

3) The person who cannot make a move in his/her turn loses the game.

Assuming both play optimally, who wins the game ?


public static void winner(int n)
    {
        if(n%2==0)
            System.out.println("ALICE");
        else
            System.out.println("BOB");
    }
